## General Information
# Business Problem Statement
This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

# Business Objective
The data for past multiple year's information about loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not has been shared. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

# Solution Approach
In this case study, we will use EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

## Conclusions
We have validated the data provided for this case study using various steps of Exploratory Data Analysis and observed our results under 2 categories:
1. Consumer attributes and loan attributes showing lesser impact to the trend of loan default
2. Consumer attributes and loan attributes showing higher impact to the trend of loan default
